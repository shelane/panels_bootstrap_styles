Administration menu (back-end) for Drupal

Provides a theme-independent administration interface (aka. "navigation", "back-end"). It's a helper for novice users coming from other CMS, a time-saver for site administrators, and useful for developers and site builders.

Administrative links are displayed in a CSS/JS-based menu at the top on all pages of your site. It not only contains regular menu items — tasks and actions are also included, enabling fast access to any administrative resource your Drupal site provides.
Showcase and Quality Assurance

    Test-drive in various themes on the demonstration site or watch a short demo reel or a installation tutorial video.

Behaviour and Integration

    Works in all themes and all browsers.
    Exposes all administration links including all tabs/tasks and actions to provide direct access to any page.
    Extensible with add-on features by other modules. Devel integration is built-in.
    Themeable administration menu icon.
    (3.x only) Implements client-side caching to minimize server-side performance impact.
    (7.x-3.x only) Exposes links to individual configuration items (e.g., content types, menus, views, etc.) including their contextual links.

Related modules

    For Drupal 8: the Admin Toolbar provides an admin_menu-like experience with core's toolbar.
    This module is intended for administrative users, not for regular/anonymous users. Try SimpleMenu, Nice Menus, or DHTML Menu.

Installation

    Read the documentation.
    Grant the "access administration menu" and "access administration pages" user permissions to selected roles.
    Drupal 6 only:
        The "Administer" menu link must be enabled, but may reside in a different menu than "Navigation".
        Ensure your theme outputs $closure. If the menu does not appear, consult the README.txt first.
